    "- Dependency inversion is a key principle that helps us write better code that we can reuse for easily.\n",
    "- It's part of group of design principles called `SOLID` (`D` stands for Dependency Inversion, we will see `SOLI` later)\n",
    "- Dependency inversion talks about the coupling between the different classes or modules. \n",
    "- It focuses on the approach where the higher classes are not dependent on the lower classes instead depend upon the abstraction of the lower classes.\n",
    "- A key ingredient of `Dependency Inversion` & many of the other design patterns that we will see later is `abstraction`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Abstraction: Separate the definition/interface from actual implementation.`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example of abstraction:\n",
    "    - If we are writing a sorting algorithm, our interface might be `algorithm expects list of some kind & a function that should tell us which element comes first as well as types of input and output [list]`\n",
    "    \n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python has no built-in mechanism to provide abstraction as well it doesn't provide types in a classical sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can use `ABC(Abstract Base Class)` to acheive abstraction & `Type Hints` to use Types.\n",
